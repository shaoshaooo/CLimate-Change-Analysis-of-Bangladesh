# Climate Change Analysis Dashboard
## Project Objective 
To visualise the trends in climate change and natural disaster frequency in Bangladesh in the last 44 years, and find explanations through results of the analysis.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/shaoshaooo/CLimate-Change-Analysis-of-Bangladesh/blob/main/original_Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.csv">Original Climate Dataset</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/shaoshaooo/CLimate-Change-Analysis-of-Bangladesh/blob/main/cleaned%20climate%20data%20to%20analyse.xlsx">Cleaned Climate Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What are the trends of disasters in the last 6 years? Find a pattern and explain.
- What are the ratios of disasters in the last 20 years?

##  Process
I used an online source for the climate change and natural disasters in Bangladesh in the last 44 years. I cleaned and transformed the messy dataset using Pandas by Python (all codes included in jupyter notebook html). Some of the main wrangling were to fill missing data cells, reduce redundant language in columns, and drop rows with specific keywords for ease of visualising. I then created clustered column charts and pie charts to visulise the trends in types of natural disasters occurring over the last 5-20 years.

## Conclusion
The total number of disasters is the hightest in 2024 when compared to the last 5 years. A rise in "Extreme Temperature" related disasters is seen, which is explained as a direct result of global warming and rise in carbon emissions.
